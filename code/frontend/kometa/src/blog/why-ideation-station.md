# Why Ideation Station?

This is my first blog post. It's going to be a bit meta and a bit personal, not really about the project itself.

## Why did I make Ideation Station?

I am a data scientist in the finance/banking industry by profession, specializing in credit modelling. There are some changes within the company, which provides an opportunity (and need) to pivot my career. I have a strong urge to build stuff, and I feel empowered by AI. But what do to build? Creativity is not my strongest suit, but according to all experts out there I should build something that cater to my interests, then I will have the best change of success. So I am thinking about it, how do I go from interests to business or product concept? There must be more people who have this issue, right? So I decided to build a tool to help me with this process. I am not sure if it will be useful for others, but I am sure it will be useful for me.

## Ideation Tool It Is

So, I am extremely AI-enthusiastic and I want to build something with langchain, I also want to build something that helps people go from idea to product. So I decided to build an ai ideation tool. This also fits very well with my career pivot, as I need to learn more about digital business, how to build and market a product, and how to do online marketing analytics.
